# Access Guru
## Overview
This Python script retrieves the AWS IAM Access Advisor data for a specific IAM user. It provides details about which AWS services the user has accessed and the last time each service was accessed. The script uses the AWS SDK for Python (boto3) to interact with the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) service.
